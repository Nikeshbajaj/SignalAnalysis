## Linear Algebra




## Covariance Matrix

Consider a matrix $X \in R^{n\times m}$, where $X$ has $n$ samples of $m$-different measuresments, i.e. $m$-channels signals. Typically, $n>m$.
Then Covariance Matrix $C_x$ is computed as:

$$C_x =  X^TX$$

which will be a $m \times m$ matrix

Now the question is, what it is, and what does it tell us.
