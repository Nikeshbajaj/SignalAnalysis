## Covariance Matrix

Consider a matrix $$X \in R^{n\times m}$$, where $$X$$ has $$n$$ samples of $$m$$-different measuresments, i.e. $$m$$-channels signals. Typically, $$n>m$$.
Then Covariance Matrix $$C_x$$ is computed as:

$$C_x =  X^TX$$

which will be a $$m \times m$$ matrix

Now the question is, what it is, and what does it tell us.
